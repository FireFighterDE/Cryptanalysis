> Info: s is choosen randomly. v is calculated according following condition: s**2 * v = 1 mod n
> Info: This means that the multiplicative element of s**2 must be calculated.
> Info: The following applies: ggT(n,s)=ggT(n,v)=1

> Note: v is smaller than 0! Original value of v=-3. Additive inverse element must be calculated
